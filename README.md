# Led Cube 8x8x8 Effects - Written in C
Here are some nice effects for led cube with dimensions 8x8x8, as seen on instructables http://www.instructables.com/id/Led-Cube-8x8x8/

The additional effects in this version are:

1. Snake (void snake);
2. Walk through walls (void walk_through_walls);
3. Bomb (void bomb);
4. Moving line (void crazy_straw);
5. 3 Moving boxes (void moving_boxes); - That one is really cool :)
6. Diagonal triangle (void diagonal_triangle);
7. Exchanging walls (void planes_exchange);
8. Arranging walls (void planes_in_order);
9. Box border animation (void border_box);

Building each of the cubes took me about a week.
